      <p>
        Hi, I'm Conway, a Junior developer who recently graduated from the
        Northcoders coding bootcamp.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I came to coding from an arts background. Years of freelancing and
        collaborative practice has made me highly self motivated, with a strong
        sense of ownership over my work, a depths of experience in meeting and
        adapting to changing briefs, and a thirst to Make Cool Stuff!
